The objective was to build a model for a car sales company. The important attributes considered were the quality of the predictions, the speed of the prediction, and the time required for training. I used scikit learn libraries to preprocess the dataset. I compared random forest, linear regression, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The metric for comparison was mean-squared error. In conclusion, the time to train and predict for the random forest model was 1 min 12s, linear regression was 21s, LGB model was 10.7s, and catboost was 49.7s. Once the parameters were set the LGB model had a faster run time. However, the CatBoost model had a slightly lower MSE score. Overall, I would recommend LGB to be the better model because it is the fastest model to fit and predict the data, and the error is not compromised by the speed.
