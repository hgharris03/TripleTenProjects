# TripleTenProjects

This is a repository highlighting some data science projects. The projects were completed as part of the data science cirriculum focusing on many machine learning concepts. The projects were completed in Jupyter Notebook. 

## [Computer Vision](https://github.com/hgharris03/TripleTenProjects/blob/main/Computer%20Vision)
- The objective was to predict the age of customers buying alcohol from a store to determine if customers are old enough. The source dataset consisted of images of individuals and ages ranging from 1 year to 100 years. TenserFlow was used for the modeling. Mean absolute error was the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. The training of the model resulted in a test MAE of 6.85. This model would be sufficient to predict the age of a consumer. Despite the low error this model could not substitute as a legal check for age but it would help flag customers who were around the legal age. As many stores are implementing more self-checkout lanes computer vision can help these lines run more efficiently without sacrificing the legal implications of selling alcohol to a minor. Computer vision has certainly increased in popularity and is now relied upon for everyday security for example on cell phones and laptops.
