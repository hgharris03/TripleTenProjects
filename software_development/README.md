Check out the app here: https://us-vehicle-ads.onrender.com

The data for the app was pulled from vehicles_us.csv, it contains information about advertisements for cars on sale. 
The objective is to screen through the ads with this user friendly app. The behind the scenes code is Python and run with streamlit. 

The first table and two charts underneath are designed to aid in the research. 
The first selection is to pick the car model from a list. Generally users will have an idea of what they want before using the app. The first table summarizes the median values of the model selected grouped by age categories. 

The next feature is the histogram that allows you to see the price distribution based on automobile condition, transmission, type, or paint color. 
The last feature is a scatter plot designed to quickly see how price is affected by odometer, transmission type, or number of cylinders. 
Below is an example of the BMW x5 split of price by condition:

The last table is the list of ads with the options to filter. 
From there are two dropdown menus to filter the car model and condition. 
There is a slider to further filter down based on days listed for sale. 

Happy car hunting!
